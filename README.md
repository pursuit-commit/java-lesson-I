# java-lesson-I
Java coding exercises for early Commit fellows. The goal is to build comfort working with Java and Kotlin, understanding their similarities and differences, and practicing working with both at the same time.

### Directions
This repo contains separate Java coding exercises in different files. The intention is that these will be copied into a fresh replit for you to practice in an easily executable environment.
